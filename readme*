This is a command line C++ program to simulate the functioning of an elevator bank. The number of floors, number of elevators, elevator weight limit, min/max wedight of the passengers and the rate at which the passengers are generated are defined in the elev.txt file.

The classes represent the elevator bank as whole, floors, individual elevators and passengers (agents). The ElevatorBank class is at the top of the hierarchy. Agents are generated on floor and passed to the elevators. See code comments for additional documentation.
